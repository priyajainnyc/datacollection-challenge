# datacollection-challenge
Homework 11 for the data collection module of Datavis bootcamp

Within the data collection challenge folder called Jupyter Notebooks CSV File, there will be the following files:

- Jupyter notebook called "part_1_mars_news.ipynb" where we scrape titles and preview text from Mars News articles
- Jupyter notebook called "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb" where we scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table
- CSV File called "mars_weather.csv" where we export the dataframe from "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb" into a CSV file
